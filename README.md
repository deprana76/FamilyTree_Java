#Family Tree Implementation

The given string has pipe delimited nodes that represent family members in a family tree. Each node is a CSV with the values being "parent_id, node_id, node_name". Write a method that takes an input string and return a single result that represents the data as a hierarchy (root, children, siblings, etc). 

Input: "null,0,grandpa|0,1,son|0,2,daugther|1,3,grandkid|1,4,grandkid|2,5,grandkid|5,6,greatgrandkid" 

Output: Displayed the output in the hierarchical order.


## How to Run

1. We can provide the input in the variable named "sampleInput" FamilyTree.java file.
2. Execute the main available in FamilyTree.java file to see the output.


## Implemented in Java 8
